My recreation of the popular game Bejeweled

Run Display_logic.py to run this game.

The script.py and game_mechanics.py files define the logic of the game board and player's controls, while Display_logic.py and Display_mechanics.py use Pygame to define the appearance and user interface through which the user interacts with the program.

The rules of the game are simple:

Columns of colored objects, or "jewels" will steadily fall from the top of the board to the bottom
Before the objects settle, the user can move them left, right, or "rotate" the order of the jewels
If there are three or more jewels in a row, column, or diagonal, they are said to "match", in which case those matched pieces will disappear.
